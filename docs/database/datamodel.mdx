# Data Modeling

Tigris is quite flexible in terms of the different types of data models that
are supported.

A collection's schema defines the structure of the documents
that are stored in the collection. This schema maps to an entity or object
in your application code. This is why you declare the data model as part of
your application code with Tigris.

Tigris also enables you to easily modify your data models, all from your
application code. See the [Schema Modification](./schema-modification.mdx)
section to learn more about evolving the data model.

## Embedded data model

Embedded documents store related data together in a single document
structure. Tigris allows you to have rich schemas that enable embedding
related data in a single document using Object and Array field types.

Embedded models allow applications to retrieve and manipulate related data
in a single database operation. The following examples demonstrate a
collection that leverages this pattern by storing related data in a single
data model:

## Relational data model

Sometimes there is a need to split related data across multiple collections.
This is known as a normalized data model - this model stores relationships
between data as references in the documents. Applications then resolve these
references when accessing the data.

Below is an example that demonstrates a normalized data model:

### Data consistency and atomicity of operations

When using a relational data model, you would have data split across
multiple collections. As a result, data modifications will likely result in
modifications to multiple documents. As Tigris provides ACID transactions,
you can safely modify multiple documents in a transactional manner with
guaranteed atomicity.

With Tigris, there is no performance penalty for multi-document transactions.
Hence, Tigris supports Embedded and relational data models equally well and
leaves the choice to the user to decide what is best for their application
use case.

When choosing the right data model to use, always think about how your
application works with the data and how the relationships between data is
represented.
