# Transactions

Transactions allow multiple clients to concurrently read and write data in
the database with ACID guarantees. By virtue of using
[FoundationDB](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/transaction-processing.html)
under the hood Tigris employs ACID transactions implicitly for all
operations.

Following are some of the properties of transactions in Tigris:

- All operations are always atomic, durable and leave the database in a
  consistent state
- Transactions are executed using optimistic concurrency control which ensures
  that documents don't need to be locked when updating
- Transactions are globally ordered and provide strict serializability guarantee

:::info Distributed ACID Transactions

Transactions in Tigris work across collections and documents without any
restrictions or performance penalty.

## How to use transactions

Transactions in Tigris can be executed in an interactive manner. You can
begin a transaction and perform multiple operations inside this
transaction's context. Commit provides all or nothing semantics by ensuring
that there are no partial updates in the database if a transaction fails.

```ts
await db.transact(async (tx) => {
  // read user 1
  const user1 = await users.findOne({ userId: 1 }, undefined, tx);

  // read user 2
  const user2 = await users.findOne({ userId: 2 }, undefined, tx);

  if (user1 === undefined || users2 === undefined) {
    throw new Error("User(s) not found"); // This will auto-rollback transaction
  }

  // deduct balance from user1
  let result = await users.updateOne(
    { userId: user1.userId },
    { balance: user1.balance - 100 },
    tx
  );

  if (!result?.modifiedCount) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to update user's balance: ${result}`); // This will auto-rollback transaction
  }

  // add balance to user2
  result = await users.updateOne(
    { userId: user2.userId },
    { balance: user2.balance + 100 },
    tx
  );

  if (!result?.modifiedCount) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to update user's balance: ${result}`); // This will auto-rollback transaction
  }
});
```
