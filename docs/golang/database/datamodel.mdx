# Data Modeling

Tigris enables the data models to be declared as part of the
application code. These data models are then converted to appropriate
objects, such as collections, on the backend.

## Declaring Models

Models are regular Go structs composed of basic Go types or custom types.
Field properties can be modified using optional "tigris" tag.

```go
type Catalog struct {
	Id         int `tigris:"primary_key,autoGenerate"`
	Name       string
	Price      float64
	Brand      string
	Labels     string
	Popularity int
}
```

### Create the Collection

Creates the collection with the model and any new operation will see the changes.

```go
err := db.CreateCollections(ctx, &Catalog{})
```

This declaration will create a collection named `catalogs`.

### Collection Names

The name of the collection is derived from the struct name. The struct
name is pluralized to snake_cases as collection name. For example, the
struct name `Catalog` is converted to `catalogs` as the collection name. While
the struct name `CatalogDetail` is converted to `catalog_details` as the
collection name.

### Field Names

The name of the fields in the struct are used as the field names in the
collection's schema. There is no conversion performed by default. To have
fields in the collection schema with a different name, you can configure
**json** field tags as can be seen below

```go
type Catalog struct {
	Id         int `json:"id" tigris:"primaryKey,autoGenerate"`
	Name       string
	Price      float64
	Brand      string
	Labels     string
	Popularity int
}
```

## Embedded Data Model

Tigris offers rich documents that enable embedding related data in a single
document. Embedded models allow applications to complete database operations
with fewer queries or updates, thus reducing query activity and increasing
efficiency.

Below is an example of embedded data model. We first define the `Product`
type and then embed it inside the `Order` type.

```go
type Product struct {
	Id       int `tigris:"primaryKey,autoGenerate"`
	Name     string
	Quantity int
	Price    float64
}

type Order struct {
	Id     int `tigris:"primaryKey,autoGenerate"`
	UserId int

	Products []Product
}
```

## Primary Key

A primary key uniquely identifies a document in the collection and enforces
the unique constraint. In the absence of a user-defined primary key, it is
auto-generated.

### Embedding Tigris metadata model

The primary key can be implicitly defined by embedding Tigris collection model,
like shown below:

```go
type Catalog struct {
    tigris.Model

	Name       string
	Price      float64
	Brand      string
	Labels     string
	Popularity int
}
```

It adds an implicit `ID` field of type UUID to the collection model.
This is useful when the user document model doesn't have unique set of fields,
or the set of fields is not suitable to be a primary key due to size, type,
sensitive content, etc...

The `ID` field is automatically populated when the document inserted into collection.

For example using the model above:

```go
catalog := tigris.GetCollection[Catalog](db)

product := Catalog{Name: "fiona handbag", Price: 99}
_, err = catalog.Insert(context.Background(), &product)
```

The ID field is automatically populated.

Note: you do not need to explicitly mention this `id: string` field to your
schema definition. It is available implicitly (as long as you don't have
primary key defined).

### Explicit ID field

You can explicitly set the type of the field with name "ID" or "Id". This field is automatically marked as
the primary key.

For example:

```go
type Catalog struct {
    ID time.Time
	Name       string
	Price      float64
	Brand      string
	Labels     string
	Popularity int
}
```

## Defining Primary Key

One or more fields in the struct can be specified as primary key by
configuring **tigris primary key** field tag. While the **autoGenerate** tag
can be used to instruct Tigris to automatically generate the values for this
field. The example below demonstrates a model with a single primary key field

```go
type CatalogDetail struct {
	Id    int `tigris:"primaryKey,autoGenerate"`
	Spec  string
	Description string
}
```

## Composite Primary Key

Composite primary keys are also supported but in case of composite keys
order of the fields is important. The example below demonstrates
how the order of the fields are defined in case of a composite primary key

```go
type CatalogDetail struct {
	Id    int `tigris:"primaryKey:1,autoGenerate"`
	Spec  string `tigris:"primaryKey:2"`
	Description string
}
```
