# Get started with Tigris

Tigris is an open source developer data platform that provides a cohesive,
flexible set of data management services with an API-like approach to interact
with data just as apps interact with other services such as Stripe. This allows
you to build dynamic, data-driven applications in an infrastructure-less way.

Tigris provides an instantaneous and code-first experience, meaning you will not
need to step out of your application code.

## Sign up

To sign up for Tigris, go to [console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/).
You can choose to authenticate with Google, GitHub, or by using an email.

## Create a project

Once you have successfully signed up, you are ready to start creating a project.
You can create a new project from the Tigris Cloud dashboard by clicking on the
[Create a new project button](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/) and
providing a project name.

## Set up a new app with Tigris

### System requirements

- Node.js v12 or newer
- MacOS, Windows, and Linux are supported

### Automated setup

Once the project is created, copy the `create-tigris-app` command that is shown

![Create a new app](/img/screenshots/create-tigris-app-dialog.jpg)

We recommend creating a new app using `create-tigris-app`, which sets up the
Tigris SDK automatically for you. (You don't need to create an empty directory.
`create-tigris-app` will make one for you.)

After the installation is complete:

- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev` to start the development server
  on `http://localhost:3000`

For more information on how to use `create-tigris-app`, you can review the
`create-tigris-app` [documentation](/create-tigris-app/).
