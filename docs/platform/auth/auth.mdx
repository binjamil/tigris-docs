# Access Control

For authentication Tigris uses [OpenID connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
built on top of OAuth 2.0 and for authorization it uses stateless
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction).

Tigris integrates with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as the authentication and
authorization providers. Tigris Cloud uses rotating JWT and uses Auth0 as the
signature authority with RS256 signature algorithm.

## Login and Signup

Users can signup and login to Tigris through the [Cloud Console](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/).

Alternatively, users can also login or signup through the cli.

```shell
tigris login
```

## Application Keys

Applications built with the Tigris client libraries require `client_id` and `client_secret`
to authenticate themselves.

Every project allows you to create one or more applications keys. See below on how to
create an application key through the Tigris Cloud Console.
