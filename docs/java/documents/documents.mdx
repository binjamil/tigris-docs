# Documents

A collection is analogous to tables in a relational database and operates on documents. Data records are stored as JSON documents.
Documents are composed of field-value pairs. The value of the field can be any of the JSON data types.

The collection offers simple and intuitive APIs for storing, querying, and searching JSON documents. Strong transaction
APIs are also offered by the collection. The transaction provides strictly serializable isolation by default.
As Tigris indexes all your data automatically, which
means the collections are both searchable and queryable by any field.
