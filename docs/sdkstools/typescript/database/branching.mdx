# Database Branching

All database operations in Tigris are performed in the context of a branch.
Every database comes with the `main` branch by default. Tigris allows you to
branch your database and create an isolated copy of your database schema with all the collections.

## Using a branch

To use a database branch in TypeScript projects, initialize the Tigris
client with the branch name.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using env file" label="Using environment">

Initialize Tigris client using a `.env` file and environment variables:

```shell
TIGRIS_URI="api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud"
TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID="xxx"
TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET="xxx"
TIGRIS_PROJECT="my-ecommerce-project"
TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH="development"
```

By instantiating a `Tigris` client without passing any configuration, the client will attempt to pull
configuration from environment variables:

```ts
const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Using config" label="Using config">

Initialize the Tigris client by passing configuration to the `Tigris` constructor:

```ts
const tigrisClient = new Tigris({
  serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
  clientId: "xxx",
  clientSecret: "xxx",
  projectName: "my-ecommerce-project",
  branch: "development",
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By setting the branch as `development`, all the schema changes and database queries would be against the `development` branch.
When you create a database, a `main` branch always exists, which essentially is the primary database
and only intended to be used in production.

### Initializing the branch automatically {#initialize-branch}

A branch needs to exist for any operations to succeed. You can automate the creation of the configured
database branch:

```ts
const db = tigrisClient.getDatabase();
await db.initializeBranch();
```

In the code above, the `db.initializeBranch()` call creates a new branch with the name defined in
the environment flag `TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH` if a branch with that name does not already exist.

## Create a database branch

We recommend using branch initialization, as shown above. However, if you need
to explicitly control branch creation, use the `createBranch()` function.

```ts
const db = tigrisClient.getDatabase();
await db.createBranch("new-branch-name");
```

Unlike `initializeBranch`, the `createBranch` function throws an error if the branch you are trying to create already exists.

## Delete a database branch

Deleting a branch will delete all the collections and data in that branch. This operation cannot be undone.

```ts
const db = tigrisClient.getDatabase();
await db.deleteBranch("existing-branch-name");
```

If you only want to delete some data or drop an entire collection, use [collection operations](delete.mdx).

:::note
The `main` database branch can never be deleted.

## Automating your development workflow

With [database branching](../../../../concepts/database/branching/), Tigris allows you to protect your production data from any unwanted changes
by having your `main` branch configured to be used only in the production environment. You can use a
[setup script](schema-bootstrap.mdx#build-script) in the project to keep your branch up to date with
models in your code.

Below is an example of a setup script:

```ts title=setup.ts
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";
import { Catalog } from "./db/models/catalog";
import { User } from "./db/models/user";

async function main() {
  // setup client
  const tigrisClient = new Tigris();
  // ensure branch exists, create it if it needs to be created dynamically
  await tigrisClient.getDatabase().initializeBranch();
  // register schemas
  await tigrisClient.registerSchemas([Catalog, User]);
}

main()
  .then(async () => {
    console.log("Setup complete ...");
    process.exit(0);
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

By triggering this setup script during build time, you always have an up-to-date schema in your branch.
