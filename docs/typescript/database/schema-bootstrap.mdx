# Automatic Schema Management

Made changes to your data models and forgot to apply them in production before deployment? Have
to communicate schema changes to others or wait for that project tracker issue to resolve? Unexpected
changes happen all the time, often by mistake and without warning. Even with change control policies
carved in stone, they may not always be followed.

Tigris lets you automate the schema management process completely and ensures that the data models
in your application are always in sync with the corresponding schema in the database. This makes the
change control as simple as a "Code review". Let's see how this works.

## How does this work?

Define your data models as usual in your TypeScript project. Register the directory with the Tigris
client during build time and let the Tigris SDK automatically synchronize your data models
with the database. This includes creating databases and collections that do not exist, as well as
applying schema changes if the data model has evolved.

For example, let's use `<project root>/models/tigris` as a standalone directory to define our models.

### Directories and Files inside `<project root>/models/tigris`

Let's take a look at following directory structure:

```text
<project root>
└── models
    └── tigris
        └── catalog
            ├── products.ts
            └── orders.ts
```

- **Directories** are used to define databases. In this example, a database name is derived from the
  directory immediately under `<project root>/models/tigris`, which in this case is `catalog`.
- **Files** inside directories are used to represent collections in the respective database. From the
  example, two collections named `products` and `orders` will be created inside `catalog`.
  Following is an example schema definition in `products.ts`

```ts title="models/tigris/catalog/products.ts"
import {
  TigrisCollectionType,
  TigrisDataTypes,
  TigrisSchema,
} from "@tigrisdata/core/dist/types";

export interface Product extends TigrisCollectionType {
  id?: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
}

export const ProductSchema: TigrisSchema<Product> = {
  id: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.INT32,
    primary_key: { order: 1, autoGenerate: true },
  },
  title: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.STRING,
  },
  description: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.STRING,
  },
  price: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.NUMBER,
  },
};
```

A file can only have 1 exported value of `TigrisSchema` type. If you are using embedded schemas, only
export the schema you want to use for Collection. Here is an example of embedded collection schema:

```ts title="User model"
export interface Status {
  lastSeenAt: string;
  memberSince: string;
}

const statusSchema: TigrisSchema<Status> = {
  lastSeenAt: { type: TigrisDataTypes.DATE_TIME },
  memberSince: { type: TigrisDataTypes.DATE_TIME },
};

export interface User extends TigrisCollectionType {
  name: string;
  status: Status;
}

export const userSchema: TigrisSchema<User> = {
  name: { type: TigrisDataTypes.STRING },
  status: { type: statusSchema },
};
```

Note, how we are only exporting `userSchema` and not using `export const statusSchema` to ensure this
file represents a single collection.

### Use this script to register models

Now, let's write a script that can trigger build time to automatically scan the models directory
and create the resources.

```ts title="scripts/setup.ts"
import { Tigris } from "@tigrisdata/core";

async function main() {
  const tigris = new Tigris({
    serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
    clientId: "Your client_id here",
    clientSecret: "Your client_secret here",
  });

  //highlight-start
  await tigris.registerSchemas("models/tigris");
  //highlight-end
}
```

### Execute setup script at build time

Include this script in `package.json` of your **npm** project and register triggers depending how your
project builds. Here are some examples for popular frameworks:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```shell
$> cd <project root>
$> npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nextjs" label="Next.js">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //highlight-start
    "setup": "npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts",
    "predev": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    //highlight-start
    "postbuild": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nuxtjs" label="NuxtJS">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //highlight-start
    "setup": "npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts",
    "predev": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "dev": "nuxt dev",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    //highlight-start
    "postbuild": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "start": "nuxt start"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="nestjs" label="NestJS">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //highlight-start
    "setup": "npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts",
    "predev": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "dev": "nest start --watch",
    "build": "nest build",
    //highlight-start
    "postbuild": "npm run setup"
    //highlight-end
    "start": "node dist/main"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="remix" label="Remix">

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //highlight-start
    "setup": "npx ts-node scripts/setup.ts",
    "predev": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "dev": "remix dev",
    "build": "remix build",
    //highlight-start
    "postbuild": "npm run setup",
    //highlight-end
    "start": "remix-serve build"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This way your data models are always synchronized with the database and you never have to step out of
your development workflow.

## FAQs

<details>
  <summary>Q - Will a database be created if it already exists?</summary>

- No, Tigris automatically detects if the database already exists.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q - Will a new collection be created if it already exists?</summary>

- No, a new collection will not be created. However, Tigris will attempt to modify the existing
  schema if there are changes. [Learn more about schema modification in Tigris](schema#modifying-the-schema)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q - What happens if there are no valid schema files in database directory?</summary>

- A database will still be created. Empty or invalid collection schema definitions will be ignored.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q - Will a database/collection be deleted if corresponding directory/file is removed?</summary>

- No, that would be an unsafe operation. Users have to explicitly delete databases and collections.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q - Is using Tigris schema manager required?</summary>

- No, this is just one convenient method to simplify your development workflow.
