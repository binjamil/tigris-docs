Tigris offers a realtime search for documents in a collection. Searching is by default enabled for a
collection, there is no setup. This guide section will walk through how to use Tigris search in
different scenarios.

<div>{props.loadOverview && <SearchOverview />}</div>

### Example collection

Let's first have the collection.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

Assuming an e-commerce website that has the above collection catalog and has 6 products(documents) in it.

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | reviews                             |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |
| 6   | running shorts | 35    | adidas       | clothing | 7          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 7.5} |

## Searching for documents

Search consists of executing a query against one or more text fields. Let's perform a simple search query to
lookup any items matching "running".

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.simpleSearch}
  asyncExample={props.asyncSimpleSearch}
/>

:::info
Search is **case insensitive** i.e. a search for term `"ruNninG"` would match all of `["Running", "running", "RUnnIng", "RUNNING"]` etc.
:::

### Phrase search

By default, search is performed over individual terms in the text. For example, search for a
query string `adventure park` in a dataset would yield following results:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "**Adventure** island and water **park**"
3. "Long Island water **park** and **adventure** activities"
4. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
5. "Hollywood **adventure park** and studios"
6. "Seaworld **adventure** and theme **park**"

The search phrase can be _escaped_ in query for exact match. In the above example, querying for exact
phrase `\"adventure park\"` would return:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
3. "The Great America **adventure park** and Zoo"

Phrases can still be combined with keywords for richer text search. Continuing above example,
the query string `kids \"adventure park\"` would result in:

1. "California's **kids adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags **kids** recreation and **adventure park**"

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.phraseSearch}</CodeBlock>

### Match all search query

When query string isn't specified or an empty string (`""`), a match all query is performed.
It returns all searchable documents, modified by any filters or search parameters used.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.matchAllSearch}</CodeBlock>

:::tip
Returning all documents is typically useful when used in conjunction with **filter**, or when
performing a faceted search across the collection.
:::

## Project search query against specific fields

We can optionally project the search query against selected fields. Continuing previous example of
searching for "running", we may not want to search in `reviews` field and avoid any
unwanted results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFields}</CodeBlock>

## Refine the search results using filters

Let's adjust the query to only return items in `price` range of **[40, 90)**. We can use
[filters](../query/#filter) in search to further refine the results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFilters}</CodeBlock>

### Exact text match

Filters can be used to match against one or more field values in a collection. For example, to
fetch all items from `brand` "adidas".

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.exactMatch}</CodeBlock>

## Faceted search

We can additionally retrieve the number of items a particular `brand` has and unique `labels`,
that match our search query.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.facetedSearch}</CodeBlock>

Facets are a specific use-case of filters, and can only be used for filterable attributes.

:::tip Faceted content navigation UI
Common application for faceted search is to build UX with quick filters, that users can use
to narrow search results in real-time. Faceted search interface presents intuitive content
navigation to the end user.
:::

## Sorting the search results

Tigris lets you specify an order to sort the search results. We can specify a ranking order in our
search query to have results sorted with more popular items appearing first.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.sortedSearch}</CodeBlock>

Many documents may have the same `popularity` score, we can specify additional user-defined sortable
field to break the tie.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.multipleSortFields}</CodeBlock>

The results will be first sorted by value of `popularity` field, `reviews.rating` will be used to
decide ordering if two matching documents have same `popularity`.

:::note
Documents can only be sorted by `integer`, `number` and `date-time` type of collection fields.
:::

## Specifying document fields to retrieve

Search query can be programmed to return only specific fields in a document in search results. We
may only need to retrieve product `name`, `brand` and `price` for our interface.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.includeFields}</CodeBlock>

On the contrary, exclusion of fields is useful to exclude/hide potentially sensitive fields or
internal metadata from the document. To include all fields except `id` and `reviews` from documents
in search results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.excludeFields}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Field selection does not impact searching, filtering and faceting capabilities for that field. For
example, if `reviews` field is not included in documents in search results, it could still be used
for text querying, filtering and/or faceting; just that matched documents won't include `reviews`
field.
:::

## Case Insensitive Search Result Filtering

Search is **case-insensitive** but the filtering to restrict the search result is **case-sensitive** by default. Tigris supports
Collation which allows you to specify string comparison rules for filtering on text fields. Set the case to `ci` in the
collation object to make it **case-insensitive**. The following example is showing when you are searching for text "running"
and you need to filter by `brand` field, but you don't care about the case.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchUsingCollation}</CodeBlock>

## Paginating through search results

### Using page numbers {#using-page-number}

To retrieve a page of results, you can simply use `search(query, page)` method with page number and
page size. Following query fetches the first page of results with page size set as **10**

```ts
const query: SearchQuery<Catalog> = {
  q: "running",
  hitsPerPage: 10, // Optional. Defaults to 20
};
const result: SearchResult<Catalog> = await catalog.search(query, 1);

console.log(result);
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
  {
    "hits": [
      {
        "document": {
          "brand": "adidas",
          "price": 35,
          "review": {
            "author": "olivia",
            "rating": 7.5
          },
          "popularity": 7,
          "id": "6",
          "labels": "clothing",
          "name": "running shorts"
        },
        "meta": {
          "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:35.000Z",
          "textMatch": {
            "fields": [
              "name"
            ],
            "score": "578730123365187697"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "document": {
          "id": "5",
          "brand": "nike",
          "name": "running shoes",
          "price": 89,
          "labels": "shoes",
          "popularity": 10,
          "review": {
            "rating": 8.5,
            "author": "olivia"
          }
        },
        "meta": {
          "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:35.000Z",
          "textMatch": {
            "fields": [
              "name"
            ],
            "score": "578730123365187697"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "facets": {},
    "meta": {
      "found": 23,
      "totalPages": 3,
      "page": {
        "current": 1,
        "size": 10
      },
      "matchedFields": [
        "name"
      ]
    }
  }
```

</details>

The `hitsPerPage` parameter controls the number of documents to include in a result page. The returned
array of documents is accessible under `hits` key along with some search metadata.

```ts
console.log(result.hits);
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
  [
    {
      "document": {
        "labels": "clothing",
        "popularity": 7,
        "id": "6",
        "name": "running shorts",
        "review": {
          "rating": 7.5,
          "author": "olivia"
        },
        "price": 35,
        "brand": "adidas"
      },
      "meta": {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:07.000Z",
        "textMatch": {
          "fields": [
            "name"
          ],
          "score": "578730123365187697"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "document": {
        "name": "running shoes",
        "id": "5",
        "price": 89,
        "popularity": 10,
        "review": {
          "author": "olivia",
          "rating": 8.5
        },
        "brand": "nike",
        "labels": "shoes"
      },
      "meta": {
        "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:07.000Z",
        "textMatch": {
          "fields": [
            "name"
          ],
          "score": "578730123365187697"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
```

</details>

Additionally, search result contains `meta` object having current page and total pages along with
other information.

```ts
console.log(result.meta);
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
  {
    "found": 23,
    "totalPages": 3,
    "page": {
      "current": 1,
      "size": 10
    },
    "matchedFields": [
      "name"
    ]
  }
```

</details>

### Infinite scrolling

Infinite scrolling also loads data in pages, it is just that the UX is more fluid.
Instead of using page number, an Iterator object can be obtained from `search()`
method call and processed iteratively.

```ts
const query: SearchQuery<Catalog> = {
  q: "running",
  hitsPerPage: 10, // Optional. Defaults to 20
};

const resultIterable: SearchIterator<Catalog> = await catalog.search(query);

for await (const result of resultIterable) {
  console.log(result);
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
  {
    "hits": [
      {
        "document": {
          "brand": "adidas",
          "price": 35,
          "review": {
            "author": "olivia",
            "rating": 7.5
          },
          "popularity": 7,
          "id": "6",
          "labels": "clothing",
          "name": "running shorts"
        },
        "meta": {
          "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:35.000Z",
          "textMatch": {
            "fields": [
              "name"
            ],
            "score": "578730123365187697"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "document": {
          "id": "5",
          "brand": "nike",
          "name": "running shoes",
          "price": 89,
          "labels": "shoes",
          "popularity": 10,
          "review": {
            "rating": 8.5,
            "author": "olivia"
          }
        },
        "meta": {
          "createdAt": "2023-03-13T21:42:35.000Z",
          "textMatch": {
            "fields": [
              "name"
            ],
            "score": "578730123365187697"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "facets": {},
    "meta": {
      "found": 23,
      "totalPages": 3,
      "page": {
        "current": 1,
        "size": 10
      },
      "matchedFields": [
        "name"
      ]
    }
  }
```

</details>

As you can see, the iterator returns the same `SearchResult` object as in [previous section](#using-page-number)
with pagination metadata.
