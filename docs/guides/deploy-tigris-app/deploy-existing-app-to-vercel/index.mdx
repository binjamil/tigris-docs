title: Deploying a Next.js Tigris Application to Vercel
---

import tigrisConfig from "@site/tigris.config.js";

This guide demonstrates two approaches to deploying an existing Next.js application built using Tigris to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

In order for Tigris to work within a Next.js application (or any other type of application) on Vercel, the Tigris environment variables must be set.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    A <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel account</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    A <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> and your application
    source code in a GitHub repository
  </li>
  <li>
    A <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>Tigris account</a> and a Tigris project
    created for your application running in development
  </li>
  <li>
    A Next.js application built using Tigris running in your development
    environment and your credentials stored in a <code>.env.local</code> file
  </li>
</ul>

If you haven't already created a project in Vercel and configured it to use your application source from your GitHub repo, you'll need to do that before proceeding.

</details>

:::info

The build for a Next.js codebase deployed to Vercel configured to use Tigris will initially fail. This is because the required Tigris project environment variables need to be added to the Vercel project.

:::

There are two methods to deploying your Next.js and Tigris application to Vercel:

1. [Use the Tigris Vercel integration with your Vercel project](#vercel-tigris-integration)
2. [Manually add the Tigris project configuration as Vercel project environment variables](#manual-env-vars)

## Use the Tigris Vercel integration with your Vercel project {#vercel-tigris-integration}

Within the Vercel dashboard, find your project and navigate to the **configuration > Integrations** page.

![vercel project integrations](/img/screenshots/vercel-project-integrations.png)

Click on the **Browse Marketplace** button, then search for **Tigris** in the input field. Next, locate and select the Vercel integration for Tigris.

![vercel tigris integration](/img/screenshots/vercel-tigris-integration.png)

For your Tigris project to be integrated with Vercel, you must authorize Vercel to access it. To begin, click on the **Add Integration** button.

![tigris integration page](/img/screenshots/tigris-integration-page.png)

Then choose a Vercel account to authorize the integration and click on the **CONTINUE** button.

![select vercel account](/img/screenshots/select-vercel-account.png)

Next, select the Vercel project you want to integrate with Tigris and click on the **CONTINUE** button.

![select vercel projec](/img/screenshots/select-vercel-project.png)

On the next screen, click on the **ADD INTEGRATION** button. Then, choose the Tigris project you want to connect the Vercel project with.

![integrating tigris project with vercel](/img/screenshots/integrating-tigris-project-with-vercel.png)

Once the Integration process is completed, you will be redirected to the success page.

![vercel tigris integration successful](/img/screenshots/vercel-tigris-integration-successful.png)

Head back to your Vercel project, and navigate to the **Deployments** section, where you will find the failed build. Click on it to view the deployment details, and then select the **Redeploy** button to redeploy your project.

With the Tigris environment variables now in place via the integration flow, your Tigris project will build and deploy successfully. Click on **Continue to Dashboard > Visit** button to preview your application.

## Manually add the Tigris project configuration as Vercel project environment variables {#manual-env-vars}

A Next.js Tigris application needs the following environment variables:

- TIGRIS_URI - the URI to your Tigris platform deployment. If you are using Tigris Cloud, this is `api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud`.
- TIGRIS_PROJECT - the name of your project in Tigris. Do not confuse this with the name of your application key.
- TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID - an application key client ID.
- TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET - an application key client secret.
- TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH - The name of the database branch. Locally you may use `develop,` and we recommend `main` for production. However, you can set this to any name you like, as you do with Git branches.

You can get your Tigris project configuration for your environment variables from two places:

1. The **Application Keys** section of your Tigris project within the Tigris Console (recommended)
2. The `.env.local` file in your local development environment (not recommended for a production app)

### Getting Tigris project configuration from the Tigris Console

To get the configuration from the Tigris console, navigate to your project and select **Application Keys**.

![Tigris project application keys within the Tigris Console](/img/screenshots/tigris-project-configuration.png)

Tigris database branching streamlines your developer experience and reduces the likelihood of you accidentally making changes to any data or schema in production. However, we still recommend you create a different application key development and production environments.

![Tigris project application key dialog within the Tigris Console](/img/screenshots/tigris-app-key-dialog.png)

With an application key created, click on the eye icon on the right of a key to open a dialog. You can then copy the following:

- **URL** for the `TIGRIS_URI`
- **Client ID** for the `TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID`
- **Client Secret** for the `TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET`
- **Name** for the `TIGRIS_PROJECT`

The value for `TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH` isn't listed here since the branch name is up to you. We'll cover this further in the [Setting the Vercel Environment Variables section](#vercel-env-vars).

### Getting your environment variables from your development `.env.local` file

:::caution

We recommend that you use different application keys for local development and production. This means you will have different values for `TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID` and `TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET`. So, this approach is **not recommended** for production apps.

:::

Within your local development environment, you will have a `.env.local` file. It will look as follows:

```dotenv title=.env
TIGRIS_URI=api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud
TIGRIS_PROJECT=nextjs_blog_starter_comments
TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID=ftSxxx
TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET=DOxxx
TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH=main
```

These are the environment variables you need to set in your Vercel project.

See [Next.js environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for more general information and other available file naming conventions.

### Setting the Vercel Environment Variables {#vercel-env-vars}

Now that you have your Tigris project configuration, you can add them to your project in Vercel.

If you are within the Vercel project set up flow, you can set environment variables there.

![configure vercel project](/img/screenshots/configure-vercel-project.png)

If your project has already been set up, then go to your project, select the **Settings** tab and then select **Environment Variables**. You can then set the required environment variables for the different Vercel environments.

We recommend the following:

| Environment variable name | Value                                                                                            | Environment(s)      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| TIGRIS_URI                | The URI to your Tigris deployment. For Tigris Cloud this is https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud | Production, Preview |
| TIGRIS_PROJECT            | your project name                                                                                | Production, Preview |
| TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID          | your production app key client ID                                                                | Production, Preview |
| TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET      | your production app key client secret                                                            | Production, Preview |
| TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH          | preview\_${VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF}                                                                | Preview             |
| TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH          | main                                                                                             | Production          |

For `TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH`, the convention is to use `main` for your Vercel **Production** environment. We recommend a dynamic value for the **Preview** environment. For example, `preview_${VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF}` for a database branch per Git commit or `preview_${GIT_BRANCH}` for one per Git branch.

:::tip

You can also set environment variables in Vercel using the Vercel CLI and the [`vercel env` command](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/env).

:::

When complete, the Vercel environmental variable configuration will look as follows:

![Vercel Tigris project environment variables configuration within the Vercel dashboard](/img/screenshots/tigris-vercel-env-vars.png)

After you have added all the necessary environment variables, you will need to trigger a deployment.

If you are in the Vercel project set up flow, click the **Deploy** button.

Otherwise, head to the **Deployments** section of your project within the Vercel dashboard, select a deployment, and then click **Redeploy**. The new deployment will pick up the newly set environment variables.
