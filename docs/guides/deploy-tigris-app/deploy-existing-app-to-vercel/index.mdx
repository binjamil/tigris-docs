# Integrating Tigris into an application deployed to Vercel

This guide focuses on demonstrating the different methods for deploying an existing Next.js application that is built using Tigris to Vercel. There are two main options available: integrating Tigris into the project deployed on Vercel, or manually adding the Tigris project credentials during the deployment process. The guide covers both methods in detail, with step-by-step instructions
