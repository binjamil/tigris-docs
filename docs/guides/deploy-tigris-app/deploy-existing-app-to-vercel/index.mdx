title: Deploying an existing Next.js Tigris Application to Vercel
---

import tigrisConfig from "@site/tigris.config.js";

This guide focuses on demonstrating the different methods for deploying an existing Next.js application built using Tigris to Vercel. There are two main options available: [manually adding the Tigris project credentials](#manually-adding-the-tigris-project-credentials) during the deployment process or [integrating Tigris into the project deployed on Vercel](#integrating-tigris-into-the-project-deployed-on-vercel). The guide covers both methods in detail, with step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)
- Sign up on [Tigris console](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- Fork the [Next.js starter blog comments](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/next.js-tigris-blog-comment) repository.

## Create New Vercel Project

On your Vercel dashboard, click on `Add New > Project` button at the right hand-side to create a new Vercel site for your project.

Then enter the git repo name, corresponding to the project, in the search box and click on the `Import` button.

For the purpose of this guide we assume that the name of the git repo is `next.js-tigris-blog-comment`.

## Integrating Tigris into the project deployed on Vercel

Once you have imported the git repo as shown in the section above, click the `Deploy` button.

Your build will not be successful as the Tigris credentials have yet to added into your Vercel project.
We will be adding the credentials in the following steps.

:::

### Add Tigris Integration

Navigate to the `Settings > Integrations` page of your Vercel project.

### Adding Vercel Tigris Integration

For your Tigris project to be integrated with Vercel, you need to authorize Vercel to access it. To begin, click on the `Add Integration` button.

Then choose a Vercel account to authorize the integration and click on the `CONTINUE` button.

Next, proceed by selecting the Vercel project you want to integrate with Tigris and click on the `CONTINUE` button.

### Redeploy the Project

Head back to your project, navigate to the `Deployments` section, where you will find the failed build. Click on it and select the `Deploy` button to redeploy your project.

### Preview the deployed project

Congratulations, your Tigris project deployment is successful. Click on `Continue to Dashboard > Visit` button to preview your application.

## Manually adding the Tigris project settings

The integration flow shown above allow you to connect a Tigris project to your Vercel project.

After you have completed the integration setup and successfully linked Tigris to your Vercel project,
you can see the environment variables that have been set up that connect your Vercel project to Tigris.

You can also choose to set up these environment variables directly without going through
the integration flow.

To do this, first, collapse the environment variables box in the Configure Project page.
Then copy and add your Tigris project settings and their corresponding values from your `.env.local` file.
To save a credential, click on the `Add` button and repeat the process for the next one.

![configure-vercel-project](/img/screenshots/configure-vercel-project.png)

After you have added all the necessary credentials, click the `Deploy` button to initiate the deployment process.
Allow some time for the build and deployment process to complete as Vercel works on deploying your project.
