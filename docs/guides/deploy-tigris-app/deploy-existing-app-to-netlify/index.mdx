title: Deploying an existing Next.js Tigris Application to Netlify
---

This guide will demonstrate how to deploy an existing app built with Next.js and Tigris to Netlify. There are two options for this process: Manually adding the Tigris Project credentials during deployment or Using the Netlify Tigris integration. We'll cover the two methods in detail:

## Prerequisites

- [Netlify account](https://netlify.com/)
- Sign up on [Tigris console](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- Fork the [Next.js starter blog comments](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/next.js-tigris-blog-comment) repository.

## Create New Netlify site

To begin, navigate to the Sites page on your Netlify dashboard. Once there, click the "Add new site" button and choose the option "Import an existing project" from the dropdown menu.

## Importing project from a Git repository

Next, import your project from GitHub by clicking on the GitHub button and give authorization to Netlify to access your GitHub repositories.

Now, use the search input field to locate the next.js-blog-starter-comments repository you previously cloned and select it by clicking on it.

## Manually adding the Tigris Project credentials

Let's configure your project's environment variables with your Tigris project credentials. To do this, click on the "Show advanced" button and the "New variable" button.
Copy and paste your Tigris project credentials and their corresponding values from your .env.local file. Continue to use the "New Variable" button to add all the necessary certificates.

Congratulations, your Tigris project has been successfully deployed.
Copy and paste your Tigris project credentials and their corresponding values from your .env.local file. Continue to use the "New Variable" button to add all the necessary certificates.
