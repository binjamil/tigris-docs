# TypeScript RESTful Web App

import Installation from "@site/docs/includes/_install_cloud_login.mdx";

In this guide we will build a RESTful web application that demonstrates the
following features of Tigris:

- Flexible Document Model
- Full-text Search
- Automatic Indexing
- Event Streaming
- Transactions
- Simple APIs

This tutorial would provide you with a starting point towards building a
feature rich web application.

:::info

The application uses the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

:::

## Prerequisites

<Installation />

## Getting Started

Clone the application code repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-ts.git
```

And navigate to the directory created

```shell
cd tigris-starter-ts
```

## Create a Tigris Project

To connect your e-commerce store app with a Tigris database, you need to create a Tigris project.
To create one, go to your, click **Create a new project**, name it `restapi`, and click **Create**.

### Configure environment variables

After creating a project, Tigris generates an app key with necessary credentials automatically.
Click on the **Go to Project** button and go to **Application Keys**, click the eye icon for the listed key, and a dialog will appear with values to configure your local app using environment variables.

| Dialog        | Environment variable   |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| URL           | `TIGRIS_URI`           |
| Client ID     | `TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID`     |
| Client Secret | `TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| Name          | `TIGRIS_PROJECT`       |

Create a `.env` file and add the values for `TIGRIS_URI`, `TIGRIS_PROJECT`, `TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID`, and `TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET` from the Tigris web console.
To specify a branch for the Tigris database, set the `TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH` environment variable. It is recommended to use the **main** branch in a production environment, and another branch such as **develop** in a development environment.

```dotenv title=.env.development
TIGRIS_URI=api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud
TIGRIS_PROJECT=catalog
TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID=ftSxxx
TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET=DOxxx
TIGRIS_DB_BRANCH=develop
```

## Starting the application

### Build the project

The next step is to build project

```shell
npm run build
```

### Run the application

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Using the application

### Event streaming

Every time a new user is created we publish a new event. Take a look at the
code inside [src/controllers/user-controller.ts](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-ts/blob/main/src/controllers/user-controller.ts#L90).

Let's subscribe to this event stream. Open a new terminal window and run the
following command

```shell
curl -N -X POST localhost:8080/users/subscribe
```

Keep this terminal window open so that you can watch the events live. Use a
separate terminal window for the remainder of the tutorial.

### CRUD operations

Tigris allows you to quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data
through simple and intuitive APIs. Continue using your preferred programming
language, there is no new database query language to learn.

Take a look at the source files inside
[src/controllers](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-ts/tree/main/src/controllers)
to see how Tigris CRUD APIs are used.

Let's create user and product records, and then read them back.

#### Insert users

Run following commands to create two user records

```shell
curl localhost:8080/users/create \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "name":"John",
          "balance":100
        }'
```

```shell
curl localhost:8080/users/create \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "name":"Jane",
          "balance":200
        }'
```

Now if you go back to the terminal window where you ran the
`curl .... subscribe` command you will notice two events displayed.

#### Insert products

Run the following commands to insert some product records

```shell
curl localhost:8080/products/create \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "name":"Avocado",
          "price":10,
          "quantity":5
        }'
```

```shell
curl localhost:8080/products/create \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "name":"Avocado Oil",
          "price":80,
          "quantity":15
        }'
```

```shell
curl localhost:8080/products/create \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
          "name":"Gold",
          "price":3000,
          "quantity":1
        }'
```

#### Read the records

Now go ahead and confirm that the data has been persisted

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/users
```

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/products
```

### Global search

Tigris comes with an integrated search engine that eliminates the need to
run a separate search platform and synchronize data.

Let's search for users named "Jane"

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/users/search \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"q": "jane"}'
```

Or, search for products named "avocado" and price less than 50

```shell
curl localhost:8080/products/search \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "q": "avocado",
        "searchFields": ["name"],
        "filter": {"price": {"$lt": 50}}
      }'
```

## Extending the application

One of the main features of Tigris is the ability to perform ACID
transactions. Now let's set up a HTTP handler that will perform the insert
and update operations in a transaction ensuring that the collections are
consistently updated.

Open the project in your favorite IDE and add the following to
`src/controllers/order-controller.ts`

#### Additional imports

```typescript title="order-controller.ts"
import { User } from "../models/user";
import { Product } from "../models/product";
```

#### New HTTP handler

```typescript title="order-controller.ts"
public createOrder = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  this.db.transact(async tx => {
    // get user
    const user: (User | undefined) = await this.db.getCollection<User>('users').findOne({
      userId: req.params.userId
    }, tx);
    if (user === undefined) {
      res.status(404).json({error: 'User not found'});
      return;
    }

    // get product
    const product: (Product | undefined) = await this.db.getCollection<Product>('products').findOne({
          productId: req.params.productId
        },
        tx
    );
    if (product === undefined) {
      res.status(404).json({error: 'Product not found'});
      return;
    }

    // read quantity for order
    const qty: number = Number.parseInt(req.params.quantity);

    // check quantity available
    if (qty > product.quantity) {
      res.status(412).json({error: 'Insufficient product quantity'});
      return;
    }
    const orderTotal: number = qty * product.price;

    // check balance available
    if (user.balance < orderTotal) {
      res.status(412).json({error: 'Insufficient user balance'});
      return;
    }

    // deduct balance
    await this.db.getCollection<User>('users').update(
        {
          userId: user.userId
        },
        {
          balance: user.balance - orderTotal
        },
        tx
    );
    console.log('deducted user balance');

    // deduct product quantity
    await this.db.getCollection<Product>('products').update(
        {
          productId: product.productId
        },
        {
          quantity: product.quantity - qty
        },
        tx
    );
    // create order
    const order: Order = {
      orderTotal: orderTotal,
      userId: user.userId,
      productItems: [
        {
          productId: product.productId,
          quantity: qty
        }
      ]
    };

    await this.orders.insert(order, tx);
    console.log('order created');

    res.status(200).json({status: 'Order placed successfully'});
  });
};
```

#### Configure HTTP route

Add the following new route to the `OrderController.setupRoutes` function

```typescript title="order-controller.ts"
this.router.post(`${this.path}/:userId/:productId/:quantity`, this.createOrder);
```

Now that we have set up the new HTTP route, let's use it to create a new
order record.

#### Insert an order

Replace `{user-id}`, and `{product-id}` below with IDs of the records you
see when running the commands in the [Read the records](#read-the-records)
section.

```shell
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:8080/orders/{user-id}/{product-id}/4'
```

#### Read all order records

Now go ahead and confirm that the order record has been persisted

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/orders
```

## Understanding what just happened

When you launched the application, code located in `App.initializeTigris`
created a database named **tigris_starter_ts**. It then created the
collections for storing the documents **users**, **products**, **orders**,
and **user_events** for storing the events. All of this was done
instantaneously in true serverless fashion.

The model definitions for these collections are located
inside [src/models/](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-ts/tree/main/src/models).

You also leveraged the event streaming and search features through code
without having to setup any complicated infrastructure.
