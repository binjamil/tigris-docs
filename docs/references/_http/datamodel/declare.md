# Declaring Models

A schema defines all the fields that make up the document in a collection.
Tigris follows the schema as per the JSON schema [specification](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

Every schema has three required keywords which are expressed as JSON keys:

- **title**: This keyword states the name of the collection.
- **description**: This keyword states the purpose of the collection.
- **properties**: This keyword states the fields that make up the document
  stored in the collection.

## Specification

Using these keywords the schema specification of the collection is as follows:

```shell
{
  "title": string,
  "description": string,
  "properties": {
    "field": {
      "type": integer|number|string|boolean|array|object,
      "format": int32|float|byte|uuid|date-time,
      "autoGenerate": boolean
      "description": string
    },
  },
  "primary_key": ["field"]
}
```

## Defining the properties

The fields must all have the following keywords expressed as JSON keys:

- **type**: This keyword states the data type
- **description**: This keyword describes the purpose of the field

For certain data types, the fields can optionally have **autoGenerate** JSON key
which specifies that the values for the field are automatically generated by
Tigris.

## Example Schema

Using the above specification, to model a collection `catalog` that has `id`, `name`, `price`, `brand`, `labels`,
`popularity` field and the `id` field is set as auto generated.

```json
{
  "title": "catalog",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "description": "A unique identifier for the product",
      "type": "integer",
      "autoGenerate": true
    },
    "name": {
      "description": "Name of the product",
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 128
    },
    "price": {
      "description": "Price of the product",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "brand": {
      "description": "The brand of the product",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "labels": {
      "description": "Labeling of the product",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "popularity": {
      "description": "Popularity score of the product",
      "type": "integer"
    }
  },
  "primary_key": ["id"]
}
```

## Collection Names

The name of the collection is the title specified in the schema definition.
In the example above, the name of the collection is `catalog`.

## Field Names

The field names are the keys inside the properties section of the schema. In
the example above, the fields are `id`, `name`, `price`, `brand`, `labels`,
and `popularity`.
